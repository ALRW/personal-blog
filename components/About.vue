          <p>Hi I'm Andrew, and thanks for visiting my blog</p>
          <p>
            Five years ago I left the military and started a new career as a
            software engineer. I now work as an engineering manager at Funding
            Circle helping small businesses and savers find a mutually
            beneficial way to grow financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also run
            <span class="reasontree is-size-4">
              <a href="https://reasontree.io"> ReasonTree </a>
            </span>
            where we provide cutting edge tech solutions, training and advice to
            small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I write about a range of subjects but focus on technology,
            leadership, productivity and their intersection. If you would like
            to keep up to date with my work please just enter your email below
            and i'll be in touch whenever I have something of value to share.
