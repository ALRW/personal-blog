          <p>Hi I'm Andrew, and thanks for visiting my blog</p>
          <p>
            5 years ago I left the British Army and started a new career as a
            software engineer. I now work as an engineering manager at Funding
            Circle helping small businesses and savers find a mutually
            beneficial way to grow financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also run
            <span class="reasontree is-size-4">
              <a href="https://reasontree.io"> ReasonTree </a>
            </span>
            where we provide cutting edge tech solutions, training and advice to
            small businesses.
