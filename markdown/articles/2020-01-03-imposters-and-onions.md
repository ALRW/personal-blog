I first met my former Commanding Officer (CO) when he came to give us a lecture
on the costs of leadership, a talk that was poignantly held at the Brookwood
military cemetery: home to the graves of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. He
was perfectly placed to do this having spent the last decade leading soldiers
all over the world in all the major theatres of operation that the British Army
had been involved in.

A year or so later our paths crossed again when, as a newly minted Second
Lieutenant, I was attached to his staff on operations. During this time I was
acutely aware of my own inexperience. Those around me, all my seniors, seemed to
exhibit a sense of cool calm and nowhere was this better exemplified than my CO.
In contrast I had no experience and spent most of my time scrambling around,
often unsuccessfully, trying not to let anything I did get out of control and
become a major issue.

## We're all Onions

Shortly after one particularly bad episode where I had advised against taking
what turned out to be a golden opportunity I found myself in the early morning
making an awful, tar-like instant coffee. As I poured an equally awful amount of
sugar into the mix I realised that my CO was standing next to me trying to
perform a similar operation.

“How are you doing sir?” I asked. After a stir and a brief pause, “To be honest
Andrew, I’m flying by the seat of my pants. I don’t know if you’ve heard of the
onion hypothesis? On the surface you look calm but beneath are layers of
turmoil? Well I feel like a bloody onion.”

For anyone who hasn’t experienced military life: this kind of heart to heart
conversation with your CO isn’t something that normally happens. However, once
past the shock of the exchange I realised that he had just confirmed he was
experiencing the same internal fears and frustrations as I was. And, if he, an
experienced veteran of multiple campaigns was feeling the same worries with the
vast responsibilities he had then, well, mine didn’t really matter that much.
In fact, I could probably stop worrying altogether and just get on with my life.

## Maybe we're all Imposters

Have you ever been in a situation where you felt like a complete fraud? Where
other people looked to you to be an expert on something you had no clue about?
Well it turns out you’re not alone. This phenomenon often referred to as
imposter syndrome has been talked about in [great detail](https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome)
and at great length in other places so I won't rehash that material here. The
trouble is that feeling like an imposter has an impact in one key area:
confidence. And if there’s one thing that a good leader needs, it’s to at least
**appear** confident.

## Act with Confidence

Why is confidence so important as a leader? Because at its core leadership is
the art of getting others to do what they might not otherwise do. To influence
someone to do something you need to have the confidence firstly to know what you
want them to do and secondly to convince them of the merits of this course of
action.

No one is confident the whole time but the gem of knowledge my CO imparted to me
during that coffee making session was that only you know how confident you are.
No one else needs to know unless you want them to: just as with an onion, it is
only the outside that’s visible, the inner layers are all hidden. So lesson
number one of leadership is to **act** confidently.

Helpfully there’s quite a bit of science behind this that shows that merely
acting confidently actually makes you confident so if you’re still sceptical
try spending some time adopting a few [power poses](http://blog.ted.com/10-examples-of-how-power-posing-can-work-to-boost-your-confidence/).

## Take Action

There’s an old adage in Leadership that any decision is better than no decision.
Nowhere is this adage more accurate than for a new leader who is finding their
feet and trying to **act** confidently.

If we think about this for a second we can see that it’s about your focus.
Making any decision changes this focus from multiple options to a single option
and moves you towards your ultimate focus and goal (more on goal setting another
time). If this decision turns out to be awful, no problem! You now get to
rectify the issue and continue moving forward armed with experience for the
next time.

## Listen

By now you might be thinking that this sounds like a recipe for a load of
over-inflated, overconfident leaders strutting around shooting from the hip
making a ton of awful decisions and it can. Handily though, it brings me to a
final and difficult to implement piece of advice. Your real job as a Leader is
most often just to listen.

Pop quiz. How do you make the **correct** decision in the moment?

Annoyingly the answer is you can’t. Even if it were possible, by virtue of being
a leader you are often further and further removed from the situation, location
and time at which a decision needs to be taken. The only effective way to bridge
this gap is to listen to those closer to this locus or point who will naturally
be more informed.

This is no silver bullet, those closer to the point of a decision can be just as
wrong but by forcing them to communicate their thoughts and preferences to you
alongside any other competing views you nudge the chances of it being a good
decision a few inches closer towards perfect. A top tip here, particularly for
senior leaders: you should always be wary of making a decision based on your own
experience. Rather, use your own experience to ask the right questions, to
validate that the information being presented is correct. In most cases this
approach leads towards a consensus that makes decision making almost a secondary
thought. As a handy side effect it also ensures that everyone is aware of the
competing priorities and why a decision has ultimately been made.

So the next time you’re feeling like a fraudulent leader take a pause then
**act** confidently, **take action**, particularly when making a decision is
required and last but perhaps most importantly make sure to always **listen**.
