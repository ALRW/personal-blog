This should hopefully be short and simple.

### Cookies

I tried google analytics for a little while and it was just too heavy-weight
and invasive for what I'm doing here. So there's no tracking, no cookies, and
I don't intend to change that.

### Data Collection

I use MailChimp to manage the list of people who would like to hear about
future articles I write. The only data I hold through mailchimp is your email
address if you have entered it in the subscribe form. By doing so you consent
to me using your email only for the purpose of sending you emails containing
information related to new content I have written. Every email you are sent
will contain a link to unsubscribe from the mailing list if you no longer wish
to hear from me.

### Resolving Issues

If there are any issues with any of the above you can either contact me at:

 - andrew.werner@reasontree.io

Or if you feel that I haven't resolved your issue to your satisfaction you can
report me to the Information Commissioners Office at:

 - [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk)
