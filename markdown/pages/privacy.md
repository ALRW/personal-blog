This should hopefully be short and simple.

### Cookies

I use google analytics (and therefore cookies) to understand how you are using
this site. Specifically, I want to see what articles etc. you like so I can
write more of them. If you would like more information about cookies you can
find it at [All-About-Cookies](https://allaboutcookies.org)

### Data Collection

I also use MailChimp to manage the list of people who would like to hear about
future articles I write. The only data I hold through mailchimp is your email
address if you have entered it in the subscribe form. Every email you are sent
will contain a link to unsubscribe from the mailing list if you no longer wish
to hear from me.

### Resolving Issues

If there are any issues with any of the above you can either contact me at:

 - andrew.werner@reasontree.io

Or if you feel that I haven't resolved your issue to your satisfaction you can
report me to the Information Commissioners Office at:

 - [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk)
