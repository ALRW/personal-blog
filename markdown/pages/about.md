Hi I'm Andrew, and thanks for visiting my blog

Six years ago I left the military and started a new career as a software
engineer. I now work as an engineering manager at
[Funding Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) helping small businesses and
savers find a mutually beneficial way to grow financially. I also act as a Non
Executive Director for [Shepheard-Walwyn Publishers](https://shepheard-walwyn.co.uk)

I write about a range of subjects but focus on heavily on all aspects of
leadership.

If you would like to see more of my writing please just enter your email below
and i'll be in touch whenever I have something of value to share (Usually about
once or twice a month).

Alternatively, if you'd like to see some of my work or connect with me below are
links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles.
