Hi I'm Andrew, and thanks for visiting my blog

I've done many things over the years including studying as a Sanskritist,
adventuring as an army officer, learning as a founder, building as a software
engineer and throughout it all trying to listen to, learn from, and, when given
the priviledge, lead those I was fortunate enough to spend my time with.

I now work as an engineering manager at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) helping to
bring digital payments to new part of the world.

I write about a range of subjects but focus heavily on all aspects of
leadership.

If you would like to see more of my writing please just enter your email below
and i'll be in touch whenever I have something of value to share.

Alternatively, if you'd like to see some of my work or connect with me below are
links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles.
