Hi I'm Andrew, and thanks for visiting my blog

Five years ago I left the military and started a new career as a software
engineer. I now work as an engineering manager at
[Funding Circle]('https://fundingcircle.com') helping small businesses and
savers find a mutually beneficial way to grow financially.

I also work as a Non Executive Director for
[Shepheard-Walwyn Publishers]('https://shepheard-walwyn.co.uk')

I write about a range of subjects but focus on technology, leadership,
productivity and their intersection.

If you would like to see more of my writing please just enter your email below
and i'll be in touch whenever I have something of value to share (Usually about
once or twice a month).
